# Introduction

This is just a tiny experiment of what would be to create an old Choose Your Own Adventure like book by using ebook formats. To be precise, using Markdown as source format and epub as output.

The main idea is to use chapters as the old page markers, as in  "if you choose to open the door, go to page xxx", because with digital books pages are dynamic in size and amount, but chapter markers a) always denote the start of a new page and b) are easily referenced from anywhere.

**Rules**

The rules are quite simple: Always start at the first chapter ([**I**](#i)), and always move to one of the choices you're given at the end of each chapter. Do not manually advance pages or you will spoil the fun.


# I

It's early in the morning. You just awake, had a shower and still a bit sleepy made a cup of coffee. 

You sit in front of your desk, ready to begin the day. You turn on your computer.

Go to [**II**](#ii)

# II

You stare at your big, bulky green phosphorous computer screen.

What do you do?

- If you want to connect to a BBS to check the news, go to [**III**](#iii)
- If you want to enjoy your coffee, go to [**IV**](#iv)
- If you want to do some work, go to [**V**](#v)
- If you think about following the white rabbit, go to [**VI**](#vi)


# III

Your dial-up modem makes its distinctive sound while connects to your favourite BBS. Slowly, the screen draws each line of characters and you can see the latest topics.

After some reading, you notice you've spent half an hour. Maybe it's time to do something else?

Go to [**II**](#ii)

# IV

You take a slow, tasteful sip from your coffee.

Go to [**II**](#ii)

# V

You open your editor, a simple text-editing tool, and retake your assembly code program. You don't know yet where you're going, but it is looking good.

You furiously type a few sentences as the ideas come up to your mind, before they fade out.

"Not bad", you say to yourself, as you pause to stare at the new lines you just wrote. 

You pick your cup of coffee.

Go to [**IV**](#iv)

# VI

The door knocks twice. You stand up and walk to the door, wondering who might be so early in the day.

You reach for the doorknob.

THE END
